# Hyperion

This is the tech onboarding repository for all regional companies and the group company to host exercises, videos, workshops, books and online links.

## Getting Started

When a new staff (Bob) joining, 

1) the on-boarding manager (Alice) creates a new issue (label:onboarding) under this repository with a checklist of items that Bob needs to go through.
2) Alice assigns the issue created in 1) to Bob.
3) Bob is working on all the items in the checklist, discussing his progress with fellow staff members .
4) Once Bob completed everything and close the issue.

e.g. https://github.com/GFG/hyperion/issues/1

When Bob has some ideas to contribute,
1) Bob has some ideas on improving the process or good stuffs to add. 
2) Bob creates an issue (label:feature request).
3) Repo Team reviews the feature request and comments to ask Bob go ahead to raise a Pull Request.
4) Bob creates his own branch from the Master and makes his change.
5) Bob raises a Pull Request.
6) Repo Team review and approve the PR.
7) Bob merges his change to the Master.

e.g. https://github.com/GFG/hyperion/issues/2

[Future use case] When Alice wants to create a pre-configured checklist for all new staffs,
1) Alice goes to github and configure
2) When Alice creates the issue (label:onboarding) for a new staff, she can choose to use the template created above.
