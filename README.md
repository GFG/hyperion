# Hyperion

This is the tech onboarding repository for all regional companies and the group company to host exercises, videos, workshops, books and online links.

## Getting Started

When a new staff (Sam winchester) joining, 

1) the on-boarding manager (Mary winchester) creates a new issue (label:onboarding) under this repository with a checklist of items that Bob needs to go through.
2) Mary assigns the issue created in 1) to Bob.
3) Sam is working on all the items in the checklist, discussing his progress with fellow staff members .
4) Once Sam completes everything, he closes the issue.

e.g. https://github.com/GFG/hyperion/issues/1

When Sam has some ideas to contribute,

1) Bob creates an issue (label:feature request).
2) Repo Team review the feature request to notify whether Sam should go ahead to raise a Pull Request.
3) Sam creates his own branch from the Master and makes his change.
4) Sam raises a Pull Request.
5) Repo Team review to approve the PR.
6) Sam merges his change to the Master.

e.g. https://github.com/GFG/hyperion/issues/2

[Future use case] When Mary wants to create a pre-configured checklist for all new staffs,
1) Mary goes to github to configure
2) When Mary creates the issue (label:onboarding) for a new staff, she can choose to use the template created above.
